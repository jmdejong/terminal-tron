Start the client by running './client.py' or 'python3 client.py'
The client can take a name as optional argument using the option '-n'

Start the server by running './tronserver.py'.
If it gives a permission error, try another socket file.
Use the '-s' option to select a socket file somewhere where you have permissions.
IF ANY FILE EXISTS AT THAT PATH IT WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.

To connect to a server that doesn't use the standard socket file (/tmp/tron_socket), the client should also select the socket with '-s'

If anything doesn't work, please contact me or leave something in feedback.txt
