--- Starting ---

-- client --

Start the client by executing playtron.py
The command 'tron' should work now too.
This will connect to the default socket.
The client can take a name as optional argument using the option '-n'

-- troubleshooting --

If the client crashes, this could be because the server is not running
If this happens, wait a minute. Cron should restart the server.
If this does not happen, contact me.

-- server --

The server should be running permanently.
This is for if you want to run your own server
Start the server by executing hosttron.py.
If it gives a permission error, try another socket file.
Use the '-s' option to select a socket file somewhere where you have permissions.
IF ANY FILE EXISTS AT THAT PATH IT WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.

To connect to a server that doesn't use the standard socket file (/tmp/tron_socket), the client should also select the socket with '-s'

--- Gameplay ---

Your player character has the first character of your name as sign.
Use wasd or the arrow keys to move around.
Don't hit a wall. If you hit a wall you die.
If a player dies, all living players will get 1 point.
A round ends when all players have died.
Your score is reset when disconnecting.


The client may show some blinking/flashing when used in a multiplexer like tmux or screen.

If anything doesn't work, please contact me or leave something in feedback.txt
