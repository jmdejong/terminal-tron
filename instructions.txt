--- Starting ---

Start the client by executing playtron.py
This will connect to the default socket.
The client can take a name as optional argument using the option '-n'


Start the server by executing hosttron.py.
If it gives a permission error, try another socket file.
Use the '-s' option to select a socket file somewhere where you have permissions.
IF ANY FILE EXISTS AT THAT PATH IT WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.

To connect to a server that doesn't use the standard socket file (/tmp/tron_socket), the client should also select the socket with '-s'
